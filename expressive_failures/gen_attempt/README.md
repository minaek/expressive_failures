"demo" folder contains python scripts for demos (movements are generated via joystick and jacobian control)

"description_files" folder contains xml, dae, and urdf files that are needed by some of the scripts in this repo. (might need to reconfigure paths in some of the python scripts)

"physics" folder contains practice scripts I was using long ago that run the physics engine

"practice_scripts" folder contains practice scripts with trajopt and inverse kinematics

"trajprac.py" is the current script I'm working on
